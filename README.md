# Shelby-Park-Art-Walk

This is my Code Lou Front End Web Development (Sept 2017). It's a simple website built with Bootstrap v4 + a little custom CSS + a dash of JS. Enjoy!

The site is also a thumbs up to public art pushing the evolution of my neighborhood in a positive direction. We have some lovely murals in Shelby Park.
```
The purpose of this website is to:

1. encourage people to take an art walk in Shelby Park, Louisville, KY to enjoy the murals
2. demonstrate how evolving neighborhoods benefit from large scale public art
3. inspire others to incorporate public art into their community
