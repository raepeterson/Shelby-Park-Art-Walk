# Shelby-Park-Art-Walk
This is my Code Lou project and a thumbs up to public art pushing the evolution of my neighborhood in a positive direction. 

Shelby Park's murals materialized from many sources over the past few years: a private equity firm, several local independent businesses, a 
non-profit specializing in streetscape beautification and the local neighborhood association.

I hope other transitional neighborhoods see the benefit of large scale public art and find ways to incorporate public art into their plans. 

Public art builds identity and beautifies our communities.
