# Shelby-Park-Art-Walk
This is my Code Lou project and a thumbs up to public art pushing the evolution of my neighborhood in a positive direction. 

Shelby Park's murals materialized from many sources over the past few years: a private equity firm, several local independent businesses, a 
non-profit specializing in streetscape beautification and the local neighborhood association.

The purpose of this project is to:

1. encourage people to take an art walk in Shelby Park, Louisville, KY to enjoy the murals
2. demonstrate how transitional neighborhoods benefit from large scale public art
3. inspire others to incorporate public art into their neighborhoods
